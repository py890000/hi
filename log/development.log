  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"✓", "authenticity_token"=>"aHul7VVYmPj0BKrBNlwpWkfxX5k534tMUrBhssRHOao=", "article"=>{"title"=>"ActionController", "body"=>"HTTP通訊協定是一種Request-Response(請求-回應)的流程，客戶端(通常是瀏覽器)向伺服器送出一個HTTP request封包，然後伺服器就回應一個response封包。在上一章中，我們介紹了Rails如何使用路由來分派request到Controller的其中一個Action。而每個Action的任務就是根據客戶端傳來的資料與Model互動，然後回應結果給客戶端。這一章中我們將仔細介紹負責回應請求的Controller。\r\nApplicationController\r\n\r\n預設產生出來的Controller都繼承自ApplicationController。因此定義在這裡的方法可以被所有Controller取用，你可以在這邊定義一些共用的方法。預設的application_controller.rb長的如下：\r\n\r\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\r\n  protect_from_forgery\r\nend\r\n\r\n其中的protect_from_forgery方法啟動了CSRF安全性功能，所有非GET的HTTP request都必須帶有一個Token參數才能存取，Rails會自動在所有表單中幫你插入Token參數，預設的Layout中也有一行<%= csrf_meta_tag %>標籤可以讓JavaScript讀取到這個Token。會需要關閉這個功能的時機是，你需要開放API給非瀏覽器客戶端，這時候你會需要取消它：\r\n\r\nclass ApisController < ApplicationController\r\n  skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token\r\nend\r\n\r\n    CSRF 網路攻擊 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery\r\n\r\n    注意，請將方法放在protected或private之下，如果是public方法，就會變成一個公開的Action可以給瀏覽器呼叫到。\r\n\r\n產生Controller與Action\r\n\r\n我們在Part1示範過，要產生一個Controller檔案，請輸入\r\n\r\nrails g controller events\r\n\r\n如此便會產生app/controllers/events_controller.rb，依照RESTful設計的慣例，所有的Controller命名都是複數，而檔案名稱依照慣例都是{name}_controller.rb。\r\n\r\n一個Action就是Controller裡的一個Public方法：\r\n\r\nclass EventsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def show\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n    除了繼承自ApplicationController，我們也可以繼承更底層的ActionController::Metal，請參考Rails3: 新的 Metal 機制。\r\n\r\n在Action方法中我們要處理request，基本上會做三件事情: 1. 收集request的資訊，例如使用者傳進來的參數 2. 操作Model來做資料的處理 3. 回傳response結果，這個動作稱作render\r\nRequest資訊收集\r\n\r\n在Controller的Action之中，Rails提供了一些方法可以讓你得知此request各種資訊，包括：\r\n\r\n    action_name 目前的Action名稱\r\n\r\n    cookies Cookie 下述\r\n\r\n    headers HTTP標頭\r\n\r\n    params 包含用戶所有傳進來的參數Hash，這是最常使用的資訊\r\n\r\n    request 各種關於此request的詳細資訊\r\n        request_method\r\n        method\r\n        delete?, get?, head?, post?, put?\r\n        xml_http_request? 或 xhr?\r\n        url\r\n        protocol, host, port, path 和 query_string\r\n        domain\r\n        host_with_port\r\n        port_string\r\n        ssl?\r\n        remote_ip?\r\n        path_without_extension, path_without_format_and_extension, format_and_extension, relative_path\r\n        env\r\n        accepts\r\n        format\r\n        mime_type\r\n        content_type\r\n        headers\r\n        body\r\n        content_length\r\n\r\n    response 代表要回傳的內容，會由Rails設定好。通常你會用到的時機是你想加特別的Response Header。\r\n\r\n    session Session下述\r\n\r\n    正確的說，params這個Hash是ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess物件，而不是普通的Hash而已。Ruby內建的Hash，用Symbol的hash[:foo]和用字串的hash[\"foo\"]是不一樣的，這在混用的時候常常搞錯而取不到值，算是常見的臭蟲來源。Rails在這裡使用的ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess物件，無論鍵是Symbol或字串，都指涉相同的值，減少麻煩。\r\n\r\nRender結果\r\n\r\n在根據request資訊做好資料處理之後，我們接下來就要回傳結果給用戶。事實上，就算你什麼都不處理，Action方法裡面空空如也，甚至不定義Action，Rails預設也還是會執行render方法。這個render方法會回傳預設的Template，依照Rails慣例就是app/views/{controller_name}/{action_name}。如果找不到樣板檔案的話，會出現Template is missing的錯誤。\r\n\r\n當然，有時候我們會需要自定render，也許是指定不同的Template，也許是不需要Template。這時候有以下參數可以使用：\r\n直接回傳結果\r\n\r\n    render :text => \"Hello\" 直接回傳字串內容，不使用任何樣板。\r\n    render :xml => @event.to_xml 回傳XML格式\r\n    render :json => @event.to_json 回傳JSON格式(再加上:callback就會是JSONP)\r\n    render :nothing => true 空空如也\r\n\r\n指定Template\r\n\r\n    :template 指定Template\r\n    :action 指定使用該Action的Template(注意到只是使用它的Template，而不會執行該Action內的程式)\r\n    :file 指定Template的檔名全名\r\n\r\n其他參數\r\n\r\n    :status 設定HTTP status，預設是200，也就是正常。其他常用代碼包括401權限不足、404找不到頁面、500伺服器錯誤等。\r\n    :layout 可以指定這個Action的Layout，設成false即關掉Layout\r\n\r\n補充一提，在特定情況你想把render的結果存成一個字串，例如拿到局部樣板Partials成為一個字串，這時候可以改使用render_to_string :partial => \"foobar\"\r\nRedirect\r\n\r\n如果Action不要render任何結果，而是要使用者轉向到別頁，可以使用redirect_to\r\n\r\n    redirect_to :action => \"show\", :id => @event\r\n    redirect_to :back 回到上一頁。\r\n\r\n    注意，一個Action中只能有一個render或一個redirect_to。不然你會得到一個DoubleRenderError例外錯誤。\r\n\r\n串流 Sending data\r\n\r\n如果需要回傳二進位Binary資料，有兩個方法可以使用：\r\n\r\nsend_data(data, options={}) 回傳二進位字串，接受以下參數：\r\n\r\n    data 是二進位的字串\r\n    :filename 使用者儲存下來的檔案名稱\r\n    :type 預設是application/octet-stream\r\n    :disposition inline或attachment\r\n    :status 預設是200\r\n\r\nsend_file(file_location, options={}) 回傳一個檔案，接受以下參數：\r\n\r\n    file_location 是檔案路徑和檔名\r\n    :filename 使用者儲存下來的檔案名稱\r\n    :type 預設是application/octet-stream\r\n    :disposition inline或attachment\r\n    :status 預設是200\r\n    :buffer_size stream的暫存空間，預設4096 bytes\r\n    :stream 預設是false，會先將整個檔案先載入記憶體，如果檔案非常大可能造成問題。\r\n\r\n    Rails支援X-Sendfile Header可以將傳檔的任務委派給網頁伺服器處理，降低Rails伺服器的負擔。\r\n\r\nrespond_to\r\n\r\n我們在第六章RESTful應用程式中曾經示範過用法，respond_to可以用來回應不同的資料格式。Rails內建支援格式包括有:html, :text, :js, :css, :ics, :csv, :xml, :rss, :atom, :yaml, :json等。如果需要擴充，可以編輯config/initializers/mime_types.rb這個檔案。\r\n\r\n如果你想要設定一個else的情況，你可以用:any：\r\n\r\nrespond_to do |format|\r\n  format.html\r\n  format.xml { render :xml => @event.to_xml }\r\n  format.any { render :text => \"WTF\" }\r\nend\r\n\r\nSessions\r\n\r\nHTTP是一種無狀態的通訊協定，為了能夠讓瀏覽器能夠在跨request之間記住資訊，Rails提供了Session功能，像是記住登入的狀態、記住使用者購物車的內容等等，都是用Session實作出來的。\r\n\r\n要操作Session，直接操作session這個Hash變數即可。例如：\r\n\r\nsession[:cart] = Cart.new\r\n\r\n只要是可以被序列化的物件，都可以放進session之中。當然，你不會想放太大的資料進去，這樣每次request讀取時會降低伺服器的效能。\r\nSession storage\r\n\r\nRails預設採用Cookies session storage來儲存Session資料，它是將Session資料加密後放到瀏覽器的Cookie之中。最大的好處是對伺服器的效能衝擊最低，缺點是大小最多4Kb，另外也有人擔心它的安全性。\r\n\r\n除了Cookies session storage，Rails也支援其他方式，你可以修改config/initializers/session_store.rb：\r\n\r\n    :active_record_store 使用資料庫來儲存。\r\n    :mem_cache_store 使用Memcached快取系統來儲存\r\n\r\n一般來說使用預設的Cookies session storage即可，如果對安全性較高要求，可以使用資料庫。如果希望兼顧效能，可以考慮使用Memcached。\r\n\r\n採用:active_record_store的話，必須產生sessions資料表：\r\n\r\n$ rake db:sessions:create\r\n$ rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nCookies\r\n\r\n除了Session，我們也可以直接操作底層的Cookie，以下是一些使用範例：\r\n\r\n# Sets a simple session cookie.\r\ncookies[:user_name] = \"david\"\r\n\r\n# Sets a cookie that expires in 1 hour.\r\ncookies[:login] = { :value => \"XJ-122\", :expires => 1.hour.from_now }\r\n\r\n# Example for deleting:\r\ncookies.delete :user_name\r\n\r\ncookies[:key] = {\r\n   :value => 'a yummy cookie',\r\n   :expires => 1.year.from_now,\r\n   :domain => 'domain.com'\r\n}\r\n\r\ncookies.delete(:key, :domain => 'domain.com')\r\n\r\n因為資料是存放在使用者瀏覽器，所以是安全性是不高的。如果需要存一些需要保護不想使用者知道的資料，Rails也提供了Signed方法：\r\n\r\ncookies.signed[:user_preference] = @current_user.preferences\r\n\r\n另外，如果是盡可能永遠留在使用者瀏覽器的資料，可以使用Permanent方法：\r\n\r\ncookies.permanent[:remember_me] = [current_user.id, current_user.salt]\r\n\r\n兩者也可以加在一起用：\r\n\r\ncookies.permanent.signed[:remember_me] = [current_user.id, current_user.salt]\r\n\r\nFlash訊息\r\n\r\n我們在Part1示範過用Flash來傳遞訊息。它的用處在於redirect時，能夠從這一個request傳遞文字訊息到下一個request，例如從create Action傳遞「成功建立」的訊息到show Action。\r\n\r\nflash是一個Hash，其中的鍵你可以自定，常用:notice、:warning或:error等。例如我們在第一個Action中設定它：\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @event = Event.create(params[:event])\r\n  flash[:notice] = \"成功建立\"\r\n  redirect_to :action => :show\r\nend\r\n\r\n那麼在下一個Action中，我們就可以在Template中讀取到這個訊息，通常我們會放在Layout中：\r\n\r\n<p><%= flash[:notice] %></p>\r\n\r\n使用過一次之後，Rails就會自動清除flash。\r\n\r\n另外，有時候你等不及到下一個Action，就想讓Template在同一個Action中讀取到flash值，這時候你可以寫成：\r\n\r\nflash.now[:notice] = \"foobar\"\r\n\r\nFilters\r\n\r\n可將Controller中重複的程式抽出來，有三種方法可以定義在進入Action之前、之中或之後執行特定方法，分別是before_filter、after_filter和around_filter，其中before_filter最為常用。這三個方法可以接受Code block、一個Symbol方法名稱或是一個物件(Rails會呼叫此物件的filter方法)。\r\nbefore_filter\r\n\r\nbefore_filter最常用於準備跨Action共用的資料，或是使用者權限驗證等等：\r\n\r\nclass EventsControler < ApplicationController\r\n  before_filter :find_event, :only => :show\r\n\r\n  def show\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  protected\r\n\r\n  def find_event\r\n    @event = Event.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n  \r\nend\r\n\r\n每一個都可以搭配:only或:except參數。\r\naround_filter\r\n\r\n# app/controllers/benchmark_filter.rb\r\nclass BenchmarkFilter\r\n    def self.filter(controller)\r\n     timer = Time.now\r\n     Rails.logger.debug \"---\#{controller.controller_name} \#{controller.action_name}\"\r\n     yield # 這裡讓出來執行Action動作\r\n     elapsed_time = Time.now - timer\r\n     Rails.logger.debug

ApplicationController\r\n    around_filter BenchmarkFilter\r\nend\r\n\r\nFilter的順序\r\n\r\n當有多個Filter時，Rails是由上往下依序執行的。如果需要加到第一個執行，可以使用prepend_before_filter方法，同理也有prepend_after_filter和prepend_around_filter。\r\n\r\n如果需要取消從父類別繼承過來的Filter，可以使用skip_before_filter :filter_method_name方法，同理也有skip_after_filter和skip_around_filter。\r\nrescue_from\r\n\r\nrescue_from可以在Controller中宣告救回例外，例如：\r\n\r\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\r\n\r\n    rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, :with => :show_not_found\r\n    rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid, :with => :show_error\r\n\r\n    protected\r\n\r\n    def show_not_found\r\n        # render something\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def show_error\r\n        # render something\r\n    end\r\n\r\nend\r\n\r\nHTTP Basic Authenticate\r\n\r\nRails內建支援HTTP Basic Authenticate，可以很簡單實作出認證功能：\r\n\r\nclass PostsController < ApplicationController\r\n    before_filter :authenticate\r\n\r\n    protected\r\n\r\n    def authenticate\r\n     authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|\r\n       username == \"foo\" && password == \"bar\"\r\n     end\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\n在Rails 3.1中，也可以這樣寫：\r\n\r\nclass PostsController < ApplicationController\r\n    http_basic_authenticate_with :name => \"foo\", :password => \"bar\"\r\nend", "tag_list"=>""}, "commit"=>"保存", "id"=>"1"}

ApplicationController

預設產生出來的Controller都繼承自ApplicationController。因此定義在這裡的方法可以被所有Controller取用，你可以在這邊定義一些共用的方法。預設的application_controller.rb長的如下：

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
 protect_from_forgery
end

其中的protect_from_forgery方法啟動了CSRF安全性功能，所有非GET的HTTP request都必須帶有一個Token參數才能存取，Rails會自動在所有表單中幫你插入Token參數，預設的Layout中也有一行<%= csrf_meta_tag %>標籤可以讓JavaScript讀取到這個Token。會需要關閉這個功能的時機是，你需要開放API給非瀏覽器客戶端，這時候你會需要取消它：

class ApisController < ApplicationController
 skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token
end

 CSRF 網路攻擊 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery

 注意，請將方法放在protected或private之下，如果是public方法，就會變成一個公開的Action可以給瀏覽器呼叫到。

產生Controller與Action

我們在Part1示範過，要產生一個Controller檔案，請輸入

rails g controller events

如此便會產生app/controllers/events_controller.rb，依照RESTful設計的慣例，所有的Controller命名都是複數，而檔案名稱依照慣例都是{name}_controller.rb。

一個Action就是Controller裡的一個Public方法：

class EventsController < ApplicationController
 def show
 # ...
 end
end

 除了繼承自ApplicationController，我們也可以繼承更底層的ActionController::Metal，請參考Rails3: 新的 Metal 機制。

在Action方法中我們要處理request，基本上會做三件事情: 1. 收集request的資訊，例如使用者傳進來的參數 2. 操作Model來做資料的處理 3. 回傳response結果，這個動作稱作render
Request資訊收集

在Controller的Action之中，Rails提供了一些方法可以讓你得知此request各種資訊，包括：

 action_name 目前的Action名稱

 cookies Cookie 下述

 headers HTTP標頭

 params 包含用戶所有傳進來的參數Hash，這是最常使用的資訊

 request 各種關於此request的詳細資訊
 request_method
 method
 delete?, get?, head?, post?, put?
 xml_http_request? 或 xhr?
 url
 protocol, host, port, path 和 query_string
 domain
 host_with_port
 port_string
 ssl?
 remote_ip?
 path_without_extension, path_without_format_and_extension, format_and_extension, relative_path
 env
 accepts
 format
 mime_type
 content_type
 headers
 body
 content_length

 response 代表要回傳的內容，會由Rails設定好。通常你會用到的時機是你想加特別的Response Header。

 session Session下述

 正確的說，params這個Hash是ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess物件，而不是普通的Hash而已。Ruby內建的Hash，用Symbol的hash[:foo]和用字串的hash["foo"]是不一樣的，這在混用的時候常常搞錯而取不到值，算是常見的臭蟲來源。Rails在這裡使用的ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess物件，無論鍵是Symbol或字串，都指涉相同的值，減少麻煩。

Render結果

在根據request資訊做好資料處理之後，我們接下來就要回傳結果給用戶。事實上，就算你什麼都不處理，Action方法裡面空空如也，甚至不定義Action，Rails預設也還是會執行render方法。這個render方法會回傳預設的Template，依照Rails慣例就是app/views/{controller_name}/{action_name}。如果找不到樣板檔案的話，會出現Template is missing的錯誤。

當然，有時候我們會需要自定render，也許是指定不同的Template，也許是不需要Template。這時候有以下參數可以使用：
直接回傳結果

 render :text => "Hello" 直接回傳字串內容，不使用任何樣板。
 render :xml => @event.to_xml 回傳XML格式
 render :json => @event.to_json 回傳JSON格式(再加上:callback就會是JSONP)
 render :nothing => true 空空如也

指定Template

 :template 指定Template
 :action 指定使用該Action的Template(注意到只是使用它的Template，而不會執行該Action內的程式)
 :file 指定Template的檔名全名

其他參數

 :status 設定HTTP status，預設是200，也就是正常。其他常用代碼包括401權限不足、404找不到頁面、500伺服器錯誤等。
 :layout 可以指定這個Action的Layout，設成false即關掉Layout

補充一提，在特定情況你想把render的結果存成一個字串，例如拿到局部樣板Partials成為一個字串，這時候可以改使用render_to_string :partial => "foobar"
Redirect

如果Action不要render任何結果，而是要使用者轉向到別頁，可以使用redirect_to

 redirect_to :action => "show", :id => @event
 redirect_to :back 回到上一頁。

 注意，一個Action中只能有一個render或一個redirect_to。不然你會得到一個DoubleRenderError例外錯誤。

串流 Sending data

如果需要回傳二進位Binary資料，有兩個方法可以使用：

send_data(data, options={}) 回傳二進位字串，接受以下參數：

 data 是二進位的字串
 :filename 使用者儲存下來的檔案名稱
 :type 預設是application/octet-stream
 :disposition inline或attachment
 :status 預設是200

send_file(file_location, options={}) 回傳一個檔案，接受以下參數：

 file_location 是檔案路徑和檔名
 :filename 使用者儲存下來的檔案名稱
 :type 預設是application/octet-stream
 :disposition inline或attachment
 :status 預設是200
 :buffer_size stream的暫存空間，預設4096 bytes
 :stream 預設是false，會先將整個檔案先載入記憶體，如果檔案非常大可能造成問題。

 Rails支援X-Sendfile Header可以將傳檔的任務委派給網頁伺服器處理，降低Rails伺服器的負擔。

respond_to

我們在第六章RESTful應用程式中曾經示範過用法，respond_to可以用來回應不同的資料格式。Rails內建支援格式包括有:html, :text, :js, :css, :ics, :csv, :xml, :rss, :atom, :yaml, :json等。如果需要擴充，可以編輯config/initializers/mime_types.rb這個檔案。

如果你想要設定一個else的情況，你可以用:any：

respond_to do |format|
 format.html
 format.xml { render :xml => @event.to_xml }
 format.any { render :text => "WTF" }
end

Sessions

HTTP是一種無狀態的通訊協定，為了能夠讓瀏覽器能夠在跨request之間記住資訊，Rails提供了Session功能，像是記住登入的狀態、記住使用者購物車的內容等等，都是用Session實作出來的。

要操作Session，直接操作session這個Hash變數即可。例如：

session[:cart] = Cart.new

只要是可以被序列化的物件，都可以放進session之中。當然，你不會想放太大的資料進去，這樣每次request讀取時會降低伺服器的效能。
Session storage

Rails預設採用Cookies session storage來儲存Session資料，它是將Session資料加密後放到瀏覽器的Cookie之中。最大的好處是對伺服器的效能衝擊最低，缺點是大小最多4Kb，另外也有人擔心它的安全性。

除了Cookies session storage，Rails也支援其他方式，你可以修改config/initializers/session_store.rb：

 :active_record_store 使用資料庫來儲存。
 :mem_cache_store 使用Memcached快取系統來儲存

一般來說使用預設的Cookies session storage即可，如果對安全性較高要求，可以使用資料庫。如果希望兼顧效能，可以考慮使用Memcached。

採用:active_record_store的話，必須產生sessions資料表：

$ rake db:sessions:create
$ rake db:migrate

Cookies

除了Session，我們也可以直接操作底層的Cookie，以下是一些使用範例：

# Sets a simple session cookie.
cookies[:user_name] = "david"

# Sets a cookie that expires in 1 hour.
cookies[:login] = { :value => "XJ-122", :expires => 1.hour.from_now }

# Example for deleting:
cookies.delete :user_name

cookies[:key] = {
 :value => ''a yummy cookie'',
 :expires => 1.year.from_now,
 :domain => ''domain.com''
}

cookies.delete(:key, :domain => ''domain.com'')

因為資料是存放在使用者瀏覽器，所以是安全性是不高的。如果需要存一些需要保護不想使用者知道的資料，Rails也提供了Signed方法：

cookies.signed[:user_preference] = @current_user.preferences

另外，如果是盡可能永遠留在使用者瀏覽器的資料，可以使用Permanent方法：

cookies.permanent[:remember_me] = [current_user.id, current_user.salt]

兩者也可以加在一起用：

cookies.permanent.signed[:remember_me] = [current_user.id, current_user.salt]

Flash訊息

我們在Part1示範過用Flash來傳遞訊息。它的用處在於redirect時，能夠從這一個request傳遞文字訊息到下一個request，例如從create Action傳遞「成功建立」的訊息到show Action。

flash是一個Hash，其中的鍵你可以自定，常用:notice、:warning或:error等。例如我們在第一個Action中設定它：

def create
 @event = Event.create(params[:event])
 flash[:notice] = "成功建立"
 redirect_to :action => :show
end

那麼在下一個Action中，我們就可以在Template中讀取到這個訊息，通常我們會放在Layout中：

<p><%= flash[:notice] %></p>

使用過一次之後，Rails就會自動清除flash。

另外，有時候你等不及到下一個Action，就想讓Template在同一個Action中讀取到flash值，這時候你可以寫成：

flash.now[:notice] = "foobar"

Filters

可將Controller中重複的程式抽出來，有三種方法可以定義在進入Action之前、之中或之後執行特定方法，分別是before_filter、after_filter和around_filter，其中before_filter最為常用。這三個方法可以接受Code block、一個Symbol方法名稱或是一個物件(Rails會呼叫此物件的filter方法)。
before_filter

before_filter最常用於準備跨Action共用的資料，或是使用者權限驗證等等：

class EventsControler < ApplicationController
 before_filter :find_event, :only => :show

 def show
 end

 protected

 def find_event
 @event = Event.find(params[:id])
 end
 
end

每一個都可以搭配:only或:except參數。
around_filter

# app/controllers/benchmark_filter.rb
class BenchmarkFilter
 def self.filter(controller)
 timer = Time.now
 Rails.logger.debug "---#{controller.controller_name} #{controller.action_name}"
 yield # 這裡讓出來執行Action動作
 elapsed_time = Time.now - timer
 Rails.logger.debug "---#{controller.controller_name} #{controller.action_name} finished in %0.2f" % elapsed_time
 end
end

# app/controller/events_controller.rb
class EventsControler < ApplicationController
 around_filter BenchmarkFilter
end

Filter的順序

當有多個Filter時，Rails是由上往下依序執行的。如果需要加到第一個執行，可以使用prepend_before_filter方法，同理也有prepend_after_filter和prepend_around_filter。

如果需要取消從父類別繼承過來的Filter，可以使用skip_before_filter :filter_method_name方法，同理也有skip_after_filter和skip_around_filter。
rescue_from

rescue_from可以在Controller中宣告救回例外，例如：

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

 rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, :with => :show_not_found
 rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid, :with => :show_error

 protected

 def show_not_found
 # render something
 end

 def show_error
 # render something
 end

end

HTTP Basic Authenticate

Rails內建支援HTTP Basic Authenticate，可以很簡單實作出認證功能：

class PostsController < ApplicationController
 before_filter :authenticate

 protected

 def authenticate
 authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
 username == "foo" && password == "bar"
 end
 end
end

在Rails 3.1中，也可以這樣寫：

class PostsController < ApplicationController
 http_basic_authenticate_with :name => "foo", :password => "bar"
end', "updated_at" = '2012-09-21 09:22:03.753558' WHERE "articles"."id" = 1
